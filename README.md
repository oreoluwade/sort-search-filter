# Sort-search table
- Implements a crude table created with vite.
- API data is from jsonplaceholder
- Table shows only data of the user object that has primitive values (all object keys that are arrays or objects are ignored)
- Native html elements are used (no extra packages)
- Logic for sorting and searching are primary javascript logic (Javascript array methods "sort" and "filter" as well as the localeCompare method for strings)
- Vanilla css is used for styling
